A Haskell implementation of George Karavaev

Goals:
  Listen to conversation
  Select random words, and comment or ask questions about them
    - weight this towards special words
    - use a parts of speech dictionary to respond appropriately
    - replace v's at the start of words (like vodka) with w's
    - sometimes make typos






Fixmes:
  - add or find better ways to do "_sock `fmap` ask"   (asks? helper funcs?)
  - add a randgen to the state, and make any easy "rand" wrapper we can use from BotAwesome
  - make it parse the serves response to NAMES so it can keep track of those
        + *** joined the channel
        + *** left the channel
  - make it keep a rolling history of the last 10 things said
